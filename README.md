Leveraged Tokens on Terra network
=================================

Concept for zero-sum leveraged trading pools on Terra network. Created for
Terra's Spacecamp hackathon.

Contracts
---------

This concept relies on three contracts; the source code is in the
[`contracts/`](contracts/) directory; each contract has a README roughly
explaining its contribution to the leveraged token system.

| Name                                               | Description                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`leveraged_pool`](contracts/leveraged_pool)       | Pool providing leverage on a token           |
| `leverage_factory`                                 | WIP                                          |
| `leverage_governance`                              | WIP                                          |
